    <h4>Demand Response (DR) has been around for many years. It is only in this decade however that stakeholders have started seeing an expansion
       and evolution in DR technologies and programs, driving a greater adoption across markets such as the PJM, ISO New England and New York ISO
        in the United States, the WEM and the NEM in Australia, the NEMS in Singapore, and others. Its value contribution in the wider energy
         market is starting to become clearer to both regulators and competing market participants.</h4>
         <br>

      <p>The Electricity Authority in New Zealand defines Demand Response (DR) as “end-use consumers intentionally altering their normal consumption patterns
         (by changing their instantaneous demand for electricity, the timing of their electricity consumption, or their total consumption of electricity),
          in response to electricity price changes, or to incentivise payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices
           or when system reliability is jeopardised.” While many competing definitions of demand response has been proposed, its main purpose is clear – 
           end-use consumers intentionally altering normal consumption levels to meet energy market obligations.</p>

      <p>Demand response is also an enabler initiative – it enables organisations and businesses to explore and develop technologies that have 
        consequential impacts on other business areas and the wider energy industry. For example, the development of more robust and accurate demand 
        forecasting and energy profile modelling techniques, necessary for those wanting to participate in DR, helps to enhance one’s understanding of 
        energy requirements and consumer consumption profiles. Using this knowledge, more innovative service offerings can be explored to provide greater 
        value-add to energy consumers.</p>

      <br>
         
      <h1>Why is DR starting to gain traction now?</h1>

      <p>During the recent decade, there is an increasing level of participation from the demand-side (or consumers) in the electricity sector. Combined, 
        with the recent advances made in energy technologies (e.g., automation systems, big data/analytics, etc.), the drive for decarbonisation of markets, 
        and the uptake of smart metering technologies, various energy markets have started to embrace using DR as a solution to help further regulatory and 
        wider industry goals.</p>
      <p>From our review, recent uptake of DR has been primarily driven by:</p>
      <ol style="padding-left:18px;margin-top:20px">
          <li style="margin-bottom:5px;padding-left:1em">Smart technology adoption.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:5px;padding-left:1em">Unwillingness to passively consume power.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:5px;padding-left:1em">Decarbonisation trends.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:5px;padding-left:1em">Growing importance of monitoring and transparency.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:5px;padding-left:1em">Democratisation of the power sector.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>However, all news is not good news for DR programs.</p>
        <p>The major barriers of uptake (in most markets) appears to be the limited incentives (or profits received) in 
          participating in these programmes, and the strict regulatory frameworks that inhibit participation in proposed 
          programs.</p>

        <p style="margin:30px 60px;font-style:italic">“Demand response technologies and programs have evolved to the point where value can be captured at the customer, 
          distribution and wholesale levels, but a significant gap exists between the amount of available flexible capacity and profitability margins.”</p>
        <p style="margin:30px 60px;font-style:italic">- Greentech Media, 8 May 2017</p> 

        <p>This is evident in the recent changes to market rules made in Australia. The NEM is currently reviewing whether changes can be made to wholesale market 
          rules to allow for DR aggregators to participate, not only in Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets, which was implemented during July 2017, 
          but also directly in wholesale markets as well. This would open the doors for many virtual power plants, residential and small-scale consumers to 
          participate in otherwise inaccessible markets, thereby enhancing competition and liquidity, improving efficiency of the grid and reduce network costs 
          for end-consumers</p>
          <br>
        <h1>Does DR fulfill an unmet market need?</h1>

        <p>The economic value of demand response participation to stakeholders is highly subjective however – it’s value very much depends on the conditions of the 
          market, and the profile of the DR participant. For a hydro-intensive market where most generation plants can ramp-up relatively quickly, DR solutions 
          have a reduced value when considered against other options available to meet supply shortfalls in the market. Conversely, in Australia, where 
          generation is predominantly coal and gas-fired, DR programs provides a faster solution to meeting immediate and short-term ancillary services 
          requirements that would otherwise be deferred to slow-start gas or coal-fired generation plants.</p>

          <p>Similarly, the impact of carbon intensity should also be considered carefully when regulators evaluate DR measures for meeting network obligations. 
            The reduction of generation, as a result of decreased demand, would displace otherwise carbon-intensive generation capacity in Australia. However, 
            in New Zealand, DR programs will likely displace renewable hydro capacity in the market, therefore the marginal decarbonisation benefit of DR is 
            much lower.</p>

          <br>
        <h1>Value to Consumers, Retailers and Wholesale Markets</h1>
        <p>DR impacts on all areas of the electricity value chain, but there has been an increasing focus on consumers and retailers in competitive energy markets 
          recently. It has become especially valuable when combined with innovations in the distributed energy resources (DER) sector as it has allowed participants 
          to help network operators stabilise and control grid resources for some compensation. This, in effect, seeks to expand on the full capabilities and 
          potential of disruptive technologies, such as battery storage, distributed solar, automation control systems, etc.</p>
        <p>For retailers in particular, some DR programs worth considering include the following use cases:</p>
        <ol style="padding-left:18px;margin-top:20px">
            <li style="margin-bottom:5px;padding-left:1em">Manage prudential security (for independent retailers), and exposure to wholesale market risk by 
              implementing DR programs.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:5px;padding-left:1em">Use DR programs to encourage greater consumer engagement and participation in energy markets 
              to target less-passive consumers.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:5px;padding-left:1em">Offer DR programs to provide additional revenue as a value-added service offering, on top of traditional 
              revenue received from customer supply contracts.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In the wholesale markets, generators might use DR as a way to deal with immediate, short term supply shortages resulting from plant outages or 
            unexpected capacity constraints. The value of DR compensation in most markets, however, tends to be too low for it to attract many participants. 
            The generator might find it easier and faster to ramp-up generation rather than relying on untested DR programs under these 
            situations. The value of DR programs to generators is less clear.</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Concluding thoughts</h1>
          <p>The success and uptake of DR programs will be contingent on future industry regulations. Given its uncertain role in the wider market, and the
             strict guidelines/market rules in place, much work still needs to be done before DR becomes completely ‘mainstream’ and is a commonplace
              solution in markets.</p>
          <p>The future of DR is exciting, however. Potentially, in future, consumers could be bidding their own offers directly into wholesale markets, thereby 
            formulating a price responsive demand curve – submissions of combinations of price-quantity pairs that define their willingness to 
            consume at any given price. As technology grows and consumer trends shift, demand may no longer remain static or fixed, as it has been 
            assumed in most economic contexts in the past, but instead, elastic that can increase or decrease as a result of wholesale market prices.</p>
          <p>Much more needs to be explored before anyone can be certain of its value. The benefits of DR to different stakeholders depends on circumstances and 
            many complex factors, including the degree to which one’s capacity can be flexed. This requires a deep analysis and understanding of an energy-users’ 
            business model, which is likely to be very different when compared to other consumers in separate industry sectors. The growing trend in DR highlights 
            that there is, at least, some potential value that can be captured and realised by some consumers and market participants. In what form and context 
            is still yet to be determined.</p>
